# post.news-dark-mode
Dark mode for post.news that follows the theme of your device. High contrast mode and other accessibility improvements will be coming soon.

This uses CSS variables from [post.news](post.news)' code.

There are also a number of non-theme related CSS fixes to improve the user experience.
